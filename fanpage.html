      <h2>Band History</h2>

      <p>
        Little Dragon formed in 1996 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Yukimi Nagano was in her first year in high school when she met seniors Fredrik Wallin and Erik Bodin. The three of them would meet up after school to jam. The band's name was inspired by the "Little Dragon" nickname Nagano earned due to the "fuming tantrums" she used to throw while recording in the studio.

        Litle Dragon released their first, self-titled album in 2007. Since then, they have released six albums the most recent of which "New Me, Same Us" was released in 2020. Little Dragon has collaborated with numerous various artists including Gorillaz and SBTRKT, as well as working with Rockstar Games to create two songs featured in their game Grand Theft Auto V.
